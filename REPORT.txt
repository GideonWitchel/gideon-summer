Why doesn't the starter code compile? How did you fix it?

There is an issue with include guards, because Products are being defined twice. This is fixed by adding "#pragma once" to the top of product.h

What are the average and worst case time complexities for each map operation?

O(1); O(length) in the worst case

How many collisions are you getting with your chained implementaion? 

How long was the longest list of collisions?

Describe exactly what you measured and how; consider making a new test case with more insertions.

How can you reduce the number of collisions? 

Is there any code between your two implementations of stdmap.h and chained.h that can be reused or refactored?
