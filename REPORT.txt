Why doesn't the starter code compile? How did you fix it?

What are the average and worst case time complexities for each map operation?

How many collisions are you getting with your chained implementaion? How long
was the longest list of collisions? Describe exactly what you measured and how;
consider making a new test case with more insertions. How can you reduce the
number of collisions? 

Is there any code between your two implementations of stdmap.h and chained.h
that can be reused or refactored?
