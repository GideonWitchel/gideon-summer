Stop!
If you aren't using vim already, you should try it out for this assignment. Try vimtutor if you don't get the controls.
Also, you should be completing this report on your Linux machine if you aren't using it already.

First, replace every instance of capital "the" with "the" - you can use vim or sed. List the command you used below.

:%s/THE/the/g

For each of the following exercises, list your answer along with your single-line shell command for finding the solution.
Try to use man pages before consulting the internet.

    What's your current directory?

/home/gideon/Desktop/gideon-summer
pwd

    What's the PID of your shell?

23197
echo $$
echo $BASHPID

    How many times does the string "the " appear in the gideon-summer directory and all files within

235
grep -F -r -e "the" | grep -F -c -e "the"

    How many times does the string "the " appear directly in the gideon-summer directory if you ignore case 

71
grep -F -i -e "the" * | grep -F -i -c -e "the"

    Which file (other than this) contains a line which has "the " and then later in the line has "compile"
    
reports/profiling: Templates simply replace the typenames with their times at compile time, so the code will not behave differently.
reports/map_impl: Why doesn't the starter code compile? How did you fix it?
grep -E -r -e "the .*compile"

    How many lines in the entire gideon-summer directory contain either the word "competitor" or "permitted"

2
grep -F -r -c -I -h -e "competitor" -e "permitted" | awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}'
instead of -e twice, jus do it once and make it a regular expression
"competitor|permitted"

    How many characters are in the last three lines of README.md?
    
    How many .cc files are in the gideon-summer directory? Don't use ls or grep!

    How much space is available on the "/" mount?

    How many elements are there in your PATH environment variable?


What do the different permissions bits mean for regular files? For directories?

What are the tradeoffs between soft and hard links?
