Part 1:

Amazoff, Amazon's newest competitor, is looking to open their online store. 
They have a website mostly up and running, but they don't have a way of storing 
their inventory. Unfortunately, due to privacy concerns they were unwilling to
release their production code. But luckily they have provided a toy example of 
their requirements in test.cc
